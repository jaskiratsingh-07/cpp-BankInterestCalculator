# cpp-BankInterestCalculator
A simple C++ program that calculates the future balance of bank accounts after applying an annual interest rate. VIP customers (with account numbers below 10001) receive a special 10% interest rate, while others receive the standard 8%. The program allows multiple records to be entered by the user.
